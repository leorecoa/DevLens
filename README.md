## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 1. Neural Profile Auditing
*   **Deep-Probe Analysis:** Automatically audits coding style, consistency, and stack specialization.
*   **Seniority Prediction:** AI-driven classification (Junior to Architect) based on contribution patterns.
*   **Neural Skill Matrix:** Visual radar charts powered by `recharts` to map technical DNA.
*   **Verified Tech Stack:** Automated identification of a candidate's primary and secondary languages.

### 2. Tactical Battle Mode (Comparison)
*   **Side-by-Side Evaluation:** Compare two developers directly to see who has "Strategic Superiority."
*   **Recruitment Context Payload:** Paste a Job Description (JD) to get a specialized "Fit Score" for each candidate.
*   **Neural Rationale Report:** Gemini-generated reasoning explaining why one candidate outranks the other for a specific role.

### 3. Subject AI Assistant
*   **Contextual Intelligence:** A floating chat widget dedicated to the specific candidate being viewed.
*   **On-Demand Queries:** Ask specific questions like *"How experienced is this user with Microservices?"* or *"Does their code follow SOLID principles?"*

### 4. Talent Pipeline Control
*   **Sector Management:** Create custom folders (Pipelines) to organize talent.
*   **Target Acquisition:** Save high-potential candidates to specific sectors for later review.
*   **Persistence:** LocalStorage integration ensures your scouted data remains accessible between sessions.

## 🧠 System Architecture

DevLens operates as a "Zero-Backend" intelligence unit:
1.  **Extraction:** The app pulls real-time JSON data from the GitHub API.
2.  **Structuring:** Data is cleaned and fed into Gemini 3 with strictly defined `responseSchema` outputs.
3.  **Visualization:** The structured AI response is mapped to the **Neural Skill Matrix** and **Intelligence Dashboard**.
4.  **Reasoning:** The `compareProfiles` service uses specialized prompts to simulate a competitive evaluation.

## 🔮 Future Intelligence Roadmap

*   **Multimodal Dossiers:** Use `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` to analyze candidate portfolio screenshots.
*   **Repo-Specific Audits:** Deep-cloning specific repositories to analyze complexity and security.
*   **Google Search Grounding:** Integrate `googleSearch` to verify conference talks and technical blogs.
*   **Audio Briefings:** Use `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` for 60-second audio summaries.

---

## 🛡️ Access Protocol

DevLens operates on a **Tiered Intelligence** model:
*   **Standard Unit (Free):** 3 profile probes per session.
*   **Pro Commander:** Unlimited probes, Battle Mode activation, and Priority Neural Reasoning.
