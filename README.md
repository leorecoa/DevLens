## 🛠️ Database Setup (Supabase)

To enable cloud persistence and real-time synchronization, you must execute the SQL commands found in `database.sql` within your Supabase SQL Editor.

### Security Hardening
The provided script includes fixes for common PostgreSQL security warnings:
*   **Search Path Mutable:** Trigger functions now explicitly set `search_path = public` and use `SECURITY DEFINER` to prevent search path hijacking.
*   **RLS (Row Level Security):** Policies are enabled to ensure secure anonymous access mapped to local instance IDs.

---

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### 1. Neural Profile Auditing
*   **Deep-Probe Analysis:** Automatically audits coding style, consistency, and stack specialization.
*   **Seniority Prediction:** AI-driven classification (Junior to Architect) based on contribution patterns.
*   **Neural Skill Matrix:** Visual radar charts powered by `recharts` to map technical DNA.
*   **Verified Tech Stack:** Automated identification of a candidate's primary and secondary languages.

### 2. Tactical Battle Mode (Comparison)
*   **Side-by-Side Evaluation:** Compare two developers directly to see who has "Strategic Superiority."
*   **Recruitment Context Payload:** Paste a Job Description (JD) to get a specialized "Fit Score" for each candidate.
*   **Neural Rationale Report:** Gemini-generated reasoning explaining why one candidate outranks the other for a specific role.

### 3. Subject AI Assistant
*   **Contextual Intelligence:** A floating chat widget dedicated to the specific candidate being viewed.
*   **On-Demand Queries:** Ask specific questions like *"How experienced is this user with Microservices?"* or *"Does their code follow SOLID principles?"*

### 4. Talent Pipeline Control
*   **Sector Management:** Create custom folders (Pipelines) to organize talent.
*   **Target Acquisition:** Save high-potential candidates to specific sectors for later review.
*   **Cloud Persistence:** Supabase integration ensures your scouted data remains accessible across devices.
